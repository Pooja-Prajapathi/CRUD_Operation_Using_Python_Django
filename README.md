This practical demonstration will help you to understand how to implement CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE) operations functionality in Python with DBSQLITE3 database. 
For any application which is associated with a database, we perform some operations for inserting the record [C= Create], reading the records [R=Read], updating the existing record with new value [U=Update] or 
deleting the record from the database [D=Delete]. 
So, These four operations are essentials when talking about any application where we have to use a database.
